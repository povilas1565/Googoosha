A strong password must be at least 6 characters long and contain both letters and numbers. Example: 3u4YY34, gh37cdmA, 38927kLh, 2104oLeg77 Set up your password recovery mode. Menu - Settings - Password recovery: - Password recovery by phone number. Convenient way. When recovering your password, you must enter your mobile number in international format and the year of birth (not the date). The change code will be sent to your mobile. - Password recovery via email. An easy way with an added safety factor. The recovery code will be sent to your mail, the password for which only you know. - Password recovery on the security question on the phone. If someone else has access to your mobile except you, we recommend using SMS recovery using a security question. Without answering the question, the password change code will not be sent. At least one of the recovery methods must be enabled. To avoid possible difficulties in further changing / recovering the password of the profile, we recommend that you do not ignore the password recovery item by e-mail. If your mobile number, which you used for activation, has changed, link the new number to the questionnaire. You can always change your password in your profile settings. None of the users of the application can see your phone number and email.</string>
